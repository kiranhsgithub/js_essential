Code for Javascript Essential

style rules for javascript :-

* Use camelCase for variables and function names
* When naming Objects Capitalize the first letter
* For a block of code (if, for, while, function) curly braces are opened in the same line as that of block start
```javascript

    if (x) { 
        //code
    } else {    
        //more code
    }
```
* always use blocks even with single line of code after if condition 
```javascript
    if (x) {
        console.log("Just one statement within if block");
    }
```
